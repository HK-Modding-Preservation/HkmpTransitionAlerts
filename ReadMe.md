# HkmpTransitionAlerts

This mod temporarily changes the color of any transition that has a glow effect when any player passes through it.

The duration setting is client-side and only affects what you see. It is not shared across the network.

The color setting is per player and is passed across the network. Each player may choose their own color for everyone else to see.
